# DataAnalysisJourney
I'm Danish, a final year student in Bachelor Degree in Computer Science (Computer Network) from Malaysia ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾ 

# ðŸ¤–About MeðŸ¤–

* ðŸ’»I am a major in Computer Network
* ðŸ“ŠI will undergo my internship at a company that requires me to do tasks on Data Analysis
* ðŸ†•I'm new to Data Analysis, Python, Tableau, SQL and am trying to transition into Data Analytics


So this is kind a like my journey to self-learn about Data Analysis. I don't mind shifting job scope as anything can be learn if you really put in the time and hours into it. I would like to secure a full time job after the end of my internship. For that I need to gain as many skills and knowledge I can gain. Wish me the best ðŸ’ª

### 1. 30/08/2025
I started my journey by reading **[@katiehuangx](https://github.com/katiehuangx)** [Transition-into-Data-Analytics](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Transition-into-Data-Analytics) on how she transition from an Accountant into a Data Engineer. So from her journey I've decided to study the basics of the Data Analysis from Alex's Youtube video on **SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and Python** through his free bootcamp playlist.

As of now I've made progress by learning about the Basic SQL knowledge while following the tutorial as shown by Alex, which includes the **Select statement, Where clause, Group By & Order By, Having vs Where and Limit & Aliasing.**

### 2. 31/08/2025
I continue to learn from the Alex Freeberg (Alex the Analyst) on YouTube about the Intermediate and Advanced SQL tutorial, it was easy just by watching him do it and follow along, but I still do need a lot of practices so that I can remember the use cases of the codes for real-world scenarios. 

For the Intermediate SQL tutorial I learned about **Joins, Unions, String Function, Case Statement, Subqueries and Window Function.s**

For the Advanced Tutorial SQL tutorial, I learned about **CTEs, Temporary Table, Stored Procedures and Triggers & Events.**

It was really fun actually to be able to work with data, and I'm very invested to learn more about Data Analysis

Furthermore, I also completed the **Data Cleaning Project using MySQL** which is also part of the bootcamp and I can see that it's quite complex but I do still need a lot more practices. It was very interesting on how we can work on data cleaning. The Data Cleaning project includes 
1. removing duplicates
2. standardize the data
3. null values or blank values
4. remove any null or blank columns

Overall on day 2, it was very interesting and fun to work with data and performing data analysis.

### 3. 1/09/2025
I continue to learn from the Alex Freeberg (Alex the Analyst) on YouTube on the **MySQL Exploratory Data Analysis** which is very fun, I learned on how to query and obtained meaningful insights and informations from the project's dataset.

Then I continue on **Excel tutorial** which is very very interesting, which are the **Pivot Tables, Formulas, XLOOKUP & VLOOKUP, Conditional Formating and Charts** in Excel. It's actually quite easy and could be a lot more easier if I put on more practice into it. Excel is a powerful tool to perform Data Analysis and can be transfrom into visualization which makes it much more easier for Data Analysis. Alex's teaching were so great that I could easily understand and getting more and more interested in Data Analysis.

### 4. 2/09/2025
I continue to learn from the Alex Freeberg (Alex the Analyst) on YouTube on the **Excel Data Cleaning** and I got to learn on how to properly clean datasets into an appropriate format. I got work around with Excel features and formulas and it was so much easier.

Then I continue on the **Full Project usign Excel** which I clean the datasets and further using Pivot Table to generate meaningful charts to create a Dashboard for the dataset. It is so interesting and I'm so amazed that there were so much you can do with Excel as a Data Analysis tool.

Furthermore, I started on the **Tableau** tutorial which is very new for me, and I can see that it is a Data Visualization tool to perform Data Analysis. There were so much features in Tableau that helps in visualizing the data. Some of the skills I learned from the bootcamp were 
**importing data into Tableau, 
Calculated Field Bins, 
Bar and Line Graphs, 
Density Maps, 
Joins 
and even a Full Project using Tableau**. 
Tableau is relatively new for me and I do strongly need to put more practice into using it.

### 5. 6/09/2025
On this day I continue to learn from the Alex Freeberg (Alex the Analyst) on YouTube on the **Power BI** tutorials. So far I just learned the basic on Power BI, it is such a powerfull and usefull tool to use for Data Analytics, not only it can visualize data, but it can also be use to clean a dataset (so far on what I've learned), and in my opinion I'd prefer Power BI over Excel due to its powerful features and also providing the same functionality as Excel, But for large dataset, I can say that Excel is the best choice for Data Cleaning. I started on the basic of the Power BI skills such as
**How to use Power Query, 
How to Create and Manage Relationships, 
How to Use DAX, 
How to Drill Down, 
Conditional Formating, 
Bins and 
Lists & Popular Visualization on Power BI**

Additionally I've completed a **Full Power BI Project** which covers the skills on 

**Data Cleaning, 
Data Visualization,
Creating Dashboards From Data Visualization**

The dataset contains raw data about a survey from 600-700 people on LinkedIN.

### 5. 6/09/2025
On this day I continue to learn from the Alex Freeberg (Alex the Analyst) on YouTube on the **Python** tutorials using Jupyter Notebook. I've used Jupyter Notebook on one occassion during my Final Year Project to clean datasets, and for Machine Learning evaluation. At first I'm using Google Colab but due to internet connectivity issues, I transition to using Jupyter Notebook for my FYP. 

For today's lesson, I learned about **Variables in Python** which includes 

**assigning variables** and 
**good variables naming practices** using 
**Camel Case, Pascal Case & Snake Case**. 

Then, I learned obout the **Data Types** such as 

1. **numeric** which broken down into 
1.1 **INTEGER** (+ve & -ve whole number), 
1.2 **FLOAT** (decimal) & 
1.3 **Complex Numbers** (use for imaginary numbers, j is the only letter that wll work as complex numeric). 

Furthermore on 

1. **sequence type** (strings & string index, lists & nested lists, & tuples(immunable, cannot be modify or change after creation), 
2. **boolean** (true & false), 
3. **sets** (similar to lists and tuple but, CANNOT HAVE DUPLICATES ELEMETS & VALUE IN SETS CANNOT BE ACCESSED IN INDEX BCS IT DOES NOT HAVE AN INDEX (UNORDERED)) & 
4. **dictionary** (Key/Value Pair)

Last but not least, I learned on the **Comparison, Logical and Membership Operators** which are the:

 1. (==) : Equal
 2. (!=) : Not Equal
 3. (>)  : Greater Than
 4. (<)  : Less Than
 5. (>=) : Greater Than or Equal To
 6. (<=) : Less Than or Equal To

1. **Logical Operators**
 and :(returns true if both statements are true)
 or  :(returns true if one of the statements is true)
 not :(reverse the results, returns False if the result is True)

2. **Membership Operator**
in (returns true if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object)
not in (returns true if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object)


### 6. 15/09/2025
On this day I continue to learn from the Alex Freeberg (Alex the Analyst) on YouTube on the **Python** tutorials using Jupyter Notebook. First I learned on the **IF,ELSE Statement**, which the concept is similar to other programming languages that I've learned before such as Java and C++. Next, I learned on the **FOR & WHILE Loops** which is a loop that will iterate until a condition is met. Moreover, I learned on how to create **Functions** in Python which is a very important part to learn in Python as it can be reusable to avoid writing the same block of code over and over again. Furthermore, I learned on how to **Conver Data Types** in Python which is quite easy for me to change data types between **strings, intergers, long strings, lists, sets, tuple and dictionary**. Last but not least, I built a simple BMI Calculator with Python using all that's I've learned so far throughout the bootcamp, I mean the BMI calculator is just the most basic thing I can build using Python giving that I'm a beginner, but I'm looking forward to the next lesson on Python and how can it be used for Data Analysis.


### 7. 16/09/2025
On this day I continue to learn from the Alex Freeberg (Alex the Analyst) on YouTube on the **Python** tutorials using Jupyter Notebook. Firstly, I learned on **Building an Automated File Sorter in File Explorer** which is very fun to learn, the files in the path which I specified on my laptop can be sort just based on the file type which is very useful for to help organize files in my folders. Secondly, I learned on **Inspecting Web Pages with HTML**, so that I can get the general idea on and get some basics on how to do web scraping. Next, I learned on the **BeautifulSoup + Requests**, BeautifulSoup is a Python library which is very useful and easy to use for parsing HTML and XMl documents as a way to extract data from web pages and perform web scraping while the Requests (also a Python Library) is use to fetch HTML content of a web page. Moreover, I continue on how to use the **Find & Find_all command** in order to fetch specific data and even all the data from a web page. Lastly, I proceed with the **Scraping Data From a Real Website Project** using Python on Jupyter Notebook, starting from **importing all the necessary libraries, specifying the url which is the [List of largest companies in the United States by revenue from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_in_the_United_States_by_revenue), finding the right table from the web page, fetching the rows titles, getting the row data & individual data from every rows in the first table on the web page, putting it into pandas of the DataFrame, then finally exporting the data into a csv file**. Overall the project was very necessary and helpful for me in order to understand how to scrape data from a table on a web page, all the way into creating a csv file of the data in those table. Python is very helpful and I still need to put on more practice into it order for me to truly remembers every steps of web scraping by heart while also troubleshooting and issues that rises during the process.


### 8. 18/09/2025
On this day I continue to learn from the Alex Freeberg (Alex the Analyst) on YouTube on the **Pandas** tutorials using Jupyter Notebook. Starting off with **Reading in Files using Pandas**, I learned how to use Pandas to **Read in CSV File, Text File, JSON File & Excel File, Looking at Max Rows and Columns & Looking at Data in DataFrames**. Next, I continue on **Filtering and Ordering in Pandas**, which covers the skills on how to **Filter & Order By** the data that has been imported into the Juoyter Notebook. Furthermore, I learned on **Indexing** using Pandas on **Index of imported dataset, Changing the Index, Resetting the Index, Setting the Index, Searching through an Index, Multi Index, Sort Index & Searching through Milti Index**. The dataset is about a list of all the countries in the world, and when I do the indexing, I can see that it makes data analysis works so much easier by using multi indexing as all the countries can be index based on their continent and searching through the data frame once it has been indexed makes it much more readable and the data is organized appropriately.
