# DataScienceJourney
I'm Danish, a final year student in Bachelor Degree in Computer Science (Computer Network) from Malaysia ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾ 

# ðŸ¤–About MeðŸ¤–

* ðŸ’»I am a major in Computer Network
* ðŸ“ŠI will undergo my internship at a company that requires me to do tasks on Data Analysis
* ðŸ†•I'm new to Data Analysis, Python, Tableau, SQL and am trying to transition into Data Science


So this is kind a like my journey to self-learn about Data Science. I don't mind shifting job scope as anything can be learn if you really put in the time and hours into it. I would like to secure a full time job after the end of my internship. For that I need to gain as many skills and knowledge I can gain. Wish me the best ðŸ’ª

I started my journey by reading **[@katiehuangx](https://github.com/katiehuangx)** [Transition-into-Data-Analytics](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Transition-into-Data-Analytics) on how she transition from an Accountant into a Data Engineer. So from her journey I've decided to study the basics of the Data Analysis from Alex's Youtube video on **SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and Python** through his free bootcamp playlist.

As of now I've made progress by learning about the Basic SQL knowledge while following the tutorial as shown by Alex, which includes the **Select statement, Where clause, Group By & Order By, Having vs Where and Limit & Aliasing.**

I continue to learn from the Alex Freeberg (Alex the Analyst) on YouTube about the Intermediate and Advanced SQL tutorial, it was easy just by watching him do it and follow along, but I still do need a lot of practices so that I can remember the use cases of the codes for real-world scenarios. 

For the Intermediate SQL tutorial I learned about **Joins, Unions, String Function, Case Statement, Subqueries and Window Function.s**

For the Advanced Tutorial SQL tutorial, I learned about **CTEs, Temporary Table, Stored Procedures and Triggers & Events.**

It was really fun actually to be able to work with data, and I'm very invested to learn more about Data Analysis

Furthermore, I also completed the **Data Cleaning Project using MySQL** which is also part of the bootcamp and I can see that it's quite complex but I do still need a lot more practices. It was very interesting on how we can work on data cleaning. The Data Cleaning project includes 
1. removing duplicates
2. standardize the data
3. null values or blank values
4. remove any null or blank columns

Overall on day 2, it was very interesting and fun to work with data and performing data analysis.

I continue to learn from the Alex Freeberg (Alex the Analyst) on YouTube on the **MySQL Exploratory Data Analysis** which is very fun, I learned on how to query and obtained meaningful insights and informations from the project's dataset.

Then I continue on **Excel tutorial** which is very very interesting, which are the **Pivot Tables, Formulas, XLOOKUP & VLOOKUP, Conditional Formating and Charts** in Excel. It's actually quite easy and could be a lot more easier if I put on more practice into it. Excel is a powerful tool to perform Data Analysis and can be transfrom into visualization which makes it much more easier for Data Analysis. Alex's teaching were so great that I could easily understand and getting more and more interested in Data Analysis.
