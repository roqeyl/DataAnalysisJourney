# DataScienceJourney
I'm Danish, a final year student in Bachelor Degree in Computer Science (Computer Network) from Malaysia ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡¾ 

# ğŸ¤–About MeğŸ¤–

* ğŸ’»I am a major in Computer Network
* ğŸ“ŠI will undergo my internship at a company that requires me to do tasks on Data Analysis
* ğŸ†•I'm new to Data Analysis, Python, Tableau, SQL and am trying to transition into Data Science


So this is kind a like my journey to self-learn about Data Science. I don't mind shifting job scope as anything can be learn if you really put in the time and hours into it. I would like to secure a full time job after the end of my internship. For that I need to gain as many skills and knowledge I can gain. Wish me the best ğŸ’ª
