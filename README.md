# DataScienceJourney
I'm a final year student (Computer Network) from Malaysia who will undergo my internship which require me to learn about Data Science. So this is kind a like my journey to self-learn about Data Science. 
I don't mind shifting job scope as anything can be learn if you really put in the time and hours into it. I would like to secure a full time job after the end of my internship.
For that I need to gain as many skills and knowledge I can gain.
